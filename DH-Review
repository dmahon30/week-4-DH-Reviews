## Project: Sonic Histories of Cork City

I chose to review the project review for Sonic History of Cork City (SHOCC) by reviewer and professor of cultural studies, Dr. James Mansell. His review focuses less on the technical/technological aspects of the project and more on the purpose and methodologies employed. [review](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/pub/sonic-histories-of-cork-city/release/2)


### What does the reviewer focus on?

1. What is it
2. Purpose
3. Methodology
4. Contribution to the field
5. What digital tools you need to create this project.

1. What it is: 

+ SHOCC is a digital sound and public history project exploring the links between place, sound, and history in Cork City, Ireland. The team uses archival sources to inform a  re-imagining of what Cork City might have sounded like in the past. 

2. Project purpose:

+ The overarching purpose is public enagement. The team developed an online tool allowing Cork residents to add to the city's sonic history, which is then added to a sound map on the project's Wordpress site, and each sound bite contributes to a sound archive stored in the University of College Cork (UCC) library. 

Mansell argues that the public engagement aim is significant because:
it helps us diversify listening by exploring What it means to listen to sounds of the built environment at different times, places, and from multiple perspectives.

3. Methodology: 

+ The team used "historically-informed audio production" methods to create their soundscapes, and these soundscapes are crowd-sourced (which can be considered a form of community-based research, however the reviewer does not state this type of research as part of the project methods) (Marsell, 2021). 

4. Contribution to the field of digital sound studies:

+ Connecting historical interpretation with public engagement: trying to encourage interest in the sonic past rather than resurrecting it
+ Imagination over authenticity: moving beyond sonic authenticity towards understanding what it means to listen at different times, places, and from multiple perspectives. Marsell is interested in the pedagogical capacity of this project, rather than the re-creation of "authentic" historical sounds.

5. What digital tools you need to create this:

+ Sound map using Google Maps/JotForm
+ Wordpress platform
+ Using soundcloud audio streaming embedded in the map points.

### Gaps in my knowledge

Technical gaps:

+ I've created soundmaps using ArcGIS Storymaps, and OpenStreetMaps for other projects, however I've never created a Google Map. There are GM plugins for Wordpress, however you do need an API key which makes me nervous to try it, since it's a paid service and you can accumulate costs depending on site traffic.
+ I've never used JotForm before, but I like the option of creating an easy-to-use form explaining how data is archived, shared, and presented for public use. Plus they have a free package which is useful for testing purposes.

Gaps in the theory:

+ Marsell has a research background in digital sound studies, which is outside of my research wheelhouse. I had to search terms like "archaeo-acoustic", "historical acoustemology" and Dylan Robinsons's theory of "guest listening." What I learned was that there is this debate in sound studies around listening, and the harmful tendency of soundscapes in universalizing "the listener". 
+ Marsell argues that the SHOCC project moves away from this tendency by incorporating so many different listening perspectives via crowdsourcing sound, akin to the idea that sonal interpretations are not meant to be universal - especially in the context of Robinson's work on sounds of Indigenous sovereignty (settlers, as guest listeners, will never be able to understand this sound, and recognizing this distinction is crucial to reducing the harm of settler colonial knowledge systems). 
+ As part of my interest in sound design and for my own self-education, I'm checking out Robinson's book, *Hungry Listening*, to learn more about the relationship between listening, historical trauma, settler-colonialism, and how sound can affirm marginalized value systems and identities.
